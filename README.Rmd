# Motivation
![alt text](https://github.com/shringi/AGB_Pune/blob/master/Pune_Tree_Distribution_300dpi.jpg?raw=true)

Pune Municipal Corporation conducted a tree census measuring ~40 lacs trees (displayed in red in the image above). This repository attempts to estimate the Above-ground Biomass of the trees. This repository contains the code for the purpose of making it completely open source and reproducible.

# Installation
- Make sure you have latest R & R-Studio.
- Download/Clone this repository.
- Download the raw data files from [Pune Open data portal](http://opendata.punecorporation.org/Citizen/CitizenDatasets/Index?categoryId=24&dsId=483&search=census)
- Extract and keep the data files in the folder **'01-Data\01-Raw\\Pune Tree Census August 2019'** (There are five files ex. : p1.csv, p2.csv etc.)
- Run the scripts available in the folder **"02-Code"** in sequence  

# Scripts

## **00aa-initial-data-exploration.R**
- Imports and formats the raw data properly.
- Fetches the mosts recent accepted botanical name from [Taxonomic Name Resolution Service](http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/TNRSapp.html).
- Assigns wood-density data to each species, from the [global wood density data base](https://rdrr.io/cran/BIOMASS/man/wdData.html) fecilitated by [BIOMASS: An R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BIOMASS/index.html).
- Saves the processed data in the folder **03-Tables** with an prefix "00aa"

## **01aa-AGB-Calculations.R**
- Imports the data generated by **00aa-initial-data-exploration.R**
- Calculates the AGB for each tree.
- Saves the relavant data in the foler **03-Tables** with an prefix "01aa"

## **util_AGB_Pune.R**
- Contains custom made functions used in other R-scripts.
